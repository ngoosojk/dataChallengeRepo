#### The relation between frequency, wavelength and wave speed:

- Both quantities are used to describe the characteristics of the wave, whether the lock is sound or light, which we can see in the image below.

- **frequency** $f$ describes how often a wave arrives at a certain point, and it gets measured by Hertz (Hz) = $\frac{num of cycles}{t (sec/min/day)}$, which describes the number of complete oscillations per unit time.
	- $f = 1/t$, $t$ is the period a wave takes to complete one Oscillation.
	- So, as the number of cycles increases, the time it takes to complete one cycle decreases, so they are _Inversely proportional_
- **wavelength** $\lambda$ is the measure of two similar nearest points in a wave, measured by the distance.
- **Wave speed** $v$ = $f \times \lambda$
	- Giving that speed of light is constant, the longer the wavelength $\lambda$, the smaller the frequency $f$.
