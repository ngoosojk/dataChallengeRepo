#### What is the SKA MID Band?
- A telescope hosted in South Africa, and the construction is happening now in Perth and [[Cape Town]]. 
- This telescope will be focusing on observing radio [[Pulsars]], and observation of the 21-cm [hyperfine]( https://lightmachinery.com/spectrometers/hyperfine-hf-series-spectrometers/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwuaiXBhCCARIsAKZLt3kXqqsh4v-VuY8_rFCRguW1QFvuOCiBvy6mwWsPrP106f8M3qwu_SYaAo9MEALw_wcB) spectra line to help address the [[redshfit]]. The observations will also help in measuring many other spectral lines like [[Radio transients]], and [[Magnetized plasmas]]. 
- The telescope consists of an array of [[Antennas]] (dishes), with a mix of 64 13.5-m form Merkaat, and 15-m from the SKA1.
- The SKA MID bands has many LVLs, **what are they**?
	- This can be found in [SK1-Bands](https://astronomers-old-site.skatelescope.org/ska/), where the different bands has different frequencies
