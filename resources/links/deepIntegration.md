What is [Deep integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deep_fields)?
- This is where an image gets exposed for a very long time to detect fainter objects in the sky.
- The idea is that the longer you wait, the more you collect signals or frequencies for fainter objects. We can see the following simulated image better as we increase the integration hours.

- We can also see from the image that noise decreases as we increase the integration time.
